A prototype that generates tiles, their properties and interactions with neighboring tiles.
For example: Sea tiles will increase water and sun for neighbouring tiles, while mountains will decrease sun.
Buildings should be affected by the properties of the tiles (e.g., the sun will increase the basic energy production of the power plant) and can affect neighbors (a tall building will reduce the sunlight).

Made for solarpunk community/city builder game.
